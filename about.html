        <div class="container">
          <br>
          <div>Open either a TradeMonster PaperTrade or thinkorswim papermoney account. You can Google either term or go to either of the following links:
          </div>
          </div>
          </div>
          <div>

          <div>https://papermoney.thinkorswim.com/tos/myAccounts/paperMoneyInterface/paperMoney.jsp
          </div>
          <div>Anyone can participate but must not reset their accounts nor cheat the amount of money. Both things are possible; but I have devised a way that I'll know if you do. On TradeMonster, you'll all make a trade before a certain time so I know you didn't reset your accounts, and on thinkorswim I'll base win/loss on profit/loss and also look on each account, as I can tell if you changed the amount of money or not.
          </div>
          <div>Everyone must also give me their username and password. Don't use this password on other sites, and this shouldn't be a problem. Only I will see these passwords. Also, You may not make a trade in the first 15 nor last 15 minutes of each trading day. This should get rid of most ways of cheating. I'll be able to see if you guys didn't follow one of these things, and each wrongful trade's profit will be taken away if wrongfully made, or you could be disqualified.

          <div>The Prizes:
          </div>
          <div>
            <br></div>
          <div>1st Place- $100 and your name on a plaque.
          </div>
          <div>2nd Place- $50
          </div>
          <div>3rd Place- $25
          </div>
          <div>Bonus- If you beat my TradeMonster account (which I haven't actively traded for a pretty long time but still turned from the default 100k into around 230K) you will receive at least a $100 bonus (only one person will, the highest account balance above my current one at the end of the contest)!
          </div>
          <div>
            <br></div>
          <div>These are personally paid by Luke. If any parent or someone else wants to raise the prizes, just talk to me and we'll make it happen. It would also be awesome if someone would sponsor the club or if a financial advisor, etc. allowed for the winner(s) to receive a funded brokerage account. I'll probably be talking to a few financial industry people I know, but it would be awesome if someone would decide to do that, again- just let me know. Thanks!
          </div>
          <div>
            <br></div>
          <div>I'll post each persons returns on the website so you guys can know where you stand and compete with everyone. Derek, don't get too obsessed.

          <div>OTHER CLUB INFO
          </div>
          <div>This contest will be a big part of the club. We'll use it as a means to teach basic trading, learn about finance, charting, statistics/probabilities, etc. Also, I'm working on getting speakers and if nothing else Mr. Benson himself knows a ton on trading, as he was a floor trader on a few of the exchanges (as far as I understand).
