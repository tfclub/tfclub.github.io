            <div>Everyone will get a papermoney account login. Papermoney is a "thinkorswim" account, which is a trading software. We'll use this software and our thinkorswim manuals (85 pages to help everyone- youll all get a copy of this manual) to learn trading throughout the year. It'll also be used to do our awesome contest (phstfc.com/contest), the prizes of which are listed below!

                <strong>The Prizes:</strong>
              </div>
              <div>
                <br></div>
              <div>1st Place- $100 (or likely more) and your name on a plaque.
              </div>
              <div>2nd Place- $50 (again, see later for more info on likely greater prizes)
              </div>
              <div>3rd Place- $25
              </div>
              <div>Bonus- If you beat my TradeMonster account (which I haven't actively traded for a pretty long time but still turned from the default 100k into around 230K) you will receive a $100 bonus (only one person will, the highest account balance above my current one at the end of the contest)! Also, we may be giving out some tastytrade T-Shirts and stuff. More on that later...

              <div>These are personally paid by Luke. If any parent or someone else wants to raise the prizes, just talk to me and we'll make it happen. It would also be awesome if someone would sponsor the club or if a financial advisor, etc. allowed for the winner(s) to receive a funded brokerage account. I'll probably be talking to a few financial industry people I know, but it would be awesome if someone would decide to do that, again- just let me know. Thanks!

              <div>I'll post each persons returns on the website (see contest page) so you guys can know where you stand and compete with everyone.

              <div>This contest will be a big part of the club. We'll use it as a means to teach basic trading, learn about finance, charting, statistics/probabilities, etc. Also, I'm working on getting speakers and if nothing else Mr. Benson himself knows a ton on trading, as he was a floor trader on a few of the exchanges (as far as I understand).

              <div>I have personally been trading/investing since I was 9. I'll tell you guys more in the club- thanks for reading this and being part of the club!
