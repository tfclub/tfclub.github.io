It pierced my ears, but at least I wouldn&#39;t have to have it pierce my skin, at least not today. Another cloud of dust formed, not dissimilar to the hundreds of others that had formed at the firing range this day. A single red symbol meant the same thing to you today as it did everyday: that you couldn&#39;t even think of expressing, communicating, nor performing, many of the things that consumed your admittedly doomed life. You were told, treated, and fully consigned to this supposed reality of being lesser than the Aryan soldier, carrying that red mark, who chiefly had the same flag, same family dinner, same values, and same interests as you once did- specifically as you did before you were thrown into this incomprehensibly inhuman ghetto or concentration camp. But you were Jewish, so you couldn&#39;t even be given the chance to demonstrate your value to the world. Or take the Armenians, of whom I descend, murdered for having a cross in their church or an -ian at the end of their surname. People who looked so similar, likely spoke each other&#39;s languages, and ate food like your own, killed you in a barbarous, cruel manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Many people in High School have told me that they don&#39;t really care about politics. That they will start caring when they can sign their name on a ballot or when they finish school. I often think of how different that statement would have sounded to that little Jewish boy at Auschwitz during WWII or to that Armenian boy in what should have been Armenia in 1916; or to a Sudanese girl who up to this very moment has only tasted hunger and known violence; who has only really seen paper, if at all, on a cruel, oppressive regime&#39;s construction in her native country. This, all while countless Americans laugh at the very thought of someone caring about that latest election, candidate, or issue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">That&#39;s why I care, deeply, about politics. It&#39;s not about red or blue, elephant or donkey, pro or con. It&#39;s about fully living, debating, and reveling in the freedom often clich&eacute;d but seldom understood- that the blood of courageous men was not merely spilt but rather poured out, fought for with their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor; with the improbable notion that their children, grandchildren, and even 5-great grandchildren (of which I am proud to count myself) may be able to sign said paper ballot or debate a particular topic with bold audacity. If you do not stand for something now, eventually there will be no one left to stand for you; Martin Niemoller said as much about his experiences in Nazi Germany.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">And that&#39;s why, standing in front of you today, I plead with you to research that issue, challenge figures of authority, speak your mind, stand up while you remain still able to do so! For who knows: every great empire in history has ceased being great and even to exist at some point. I further believe that we can all agree that the American Empire is no more immune to perishing off the face of the Earth than the great Roman Empire, Greek Empire, or even the Armenian Empire of old. Politics, I conclude, are awfully important. Stand for something!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
